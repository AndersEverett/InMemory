###The Map
This interactive memorial maps the longitudes and latitudes of the hometowns of every American casualty of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The database is populated with data from a CSV file generated and maintained by the AP. The databases for both wars can be found <a href src=http://nrcdata.ap.org/casualties/default.aspx?username=casualty&password=2005battle>here</a>.

###The Project
The MVP of this project originated as a final presentation piece for Dev Bootcamp, Phase 2. I have continued to work on it since then and will continue to work with the data set for data visualization projects.
